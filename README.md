# Modified-3D-UNet-Pytorch
This repository implements the modified 3D UNet architecture in pytorch from [Brain Tumor Segmentation and Radiomics Survival Prediction: Contribution to the BRATS 2017 Challenge](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.10508) Fabian Isensee et al. participating in BraTS2017.

You are able to find the PyTorch version of the modified 3D UNet in `model.py`

The model works but you have to work on data loading part and training part.

Please refer to our [BraTS2018-tumor-segmentation](https://github.com/pykao/BraTS2018-tumor-segmentation) repo if you would like to use this model on brain tumor segmentation.
