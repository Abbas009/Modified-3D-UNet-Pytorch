# Modified-3D-UNet-Pytorch
This repository implements the modified 3D UNet architecture in pytorch from [Brain Tumor Segmentation and Radiomics Survival Prediction: Contribution to the BRATS 2017 Challenge](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.10508) Fabian Isensee et al. participating in BraTS2017.

The model works but you have to work on data loading part and training part.

This is an ongoing work.
